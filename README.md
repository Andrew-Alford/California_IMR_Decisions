# California's Independent Medical Review Decisions Analysis

California permits reviews of an insurance company’s denial of services as per an individual’s health insurance plan. This is managed by the California Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC) via an Independent Medical Review (IMR) board. An IMR is a review of a denied, delayed, or modified health care service that the health plan has determined to be unnecessary. If the IMR decides in an enrollee's favor, the health plan must authorize the service or treatment requested. This data is from the California Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC). It contains 19,245 decisions from January 1, 2001 to 2016.

## Analysis Overview

In this project, we aimed to gain insights into the IMR determinations provided by the DPMH. The analysis involved several steps, including data cleaning, preprocessing, and statistical analysis. The main goals of the analysis were as follows:

1. Determine the proportion of cases where the Independent Medical Review Board upheld or overturned a health insurance plan's decision to deny coverage.

2. Identify any trends or patterns in the data that may provide insights into the decision-making process of the Independent Medical Review Board.

3. Extract key statistics and metrics that can help evaluate the effectiveness and fairness of the IMR process.

## Getting Started

To replicate or build upon our analysis, please follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Andrew-Alford/California_IMR_Decisions.git
   ```

2. Ensure you have Python installed, preferably version 3.7 or later. Additionally, install the required dependencies listed in the top of the  `IMR_Project_Code.ipynb` file.

3. Open the `IMR_Project_Code.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment. Execute the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.

## Conclusion

Through this analysis, we gained valuable insights into the IMR determinations provided by the DPMH. The findings presented in the [IMR_Project_Report.pdf](IMR_Project_Report.pdf) highlight the overall outcomes of the Independent Medical Review Board's decisions and provide recommendations for improving the health insurance coverage review process.
